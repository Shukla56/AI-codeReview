Alright, let's review that code snippet.

**❌ Bad Code:**

```javascript
const function(int c){return a+b}
```

**🔍 Issues:**

* ❌ **Syntax Error:** This code has multiple syntax errors. It's not a valid JavaScript function declaration.
* ❌ **Missing Function Name:** The function is missing a name. In JavaScript, functions assigned to a `const` variable
should either be named function expressions or arrow functions.
* ❌ **Incorrect Parameter Type Declaration:** JavaScript doesn't support explicit type declarations like `int` within
the function parameter list.
* ❌ **Undeclared Variables:** The variables `a` and `b` are used without being declared or passed as parameters to the
function. This will likely result in a `ReferenceError`.
* ❌ **Missing Semicolon (General Good Practice):** While not strictly *required* in all cases thanks to automatic
semicolon insertion (ASI), it's highly recommended to use semicolons to avoid unexpected behavior.

**✅ Recommended Fix:**

Here are a few options, depending on the intended purpose of the code.

**Option 1: Simple Addition Function (Assuming a and b are meant to be added and c is unused)**

```javascript
const add = (a, b) => {
return a + b;
};
```

💡 Improvements:

* ✔ Uses an arrow function syntax, which is concise.
* ✔ Explicitly declares `a` and `b` as parameters.
* ✔ Adds a function name (`add`).
* ✔ Removes the `int` type declaration (not valid in JavaScript).

**Option 2: Function that adds a constant value to the input c (Assuming you wanted to add something to c)**

```javascript
const addConstant = (c) => {
const a = 5; // Or whatever value you want to add.
const b = 10; // Or whatever value you want to add.
return c + a + b;
};
```

💡 Improvements:

* ✔ Uses an arrow function syntax, which is concise.
* ✔ Correctly declares c as a parameter
* ✔ Declares a and b in the function scope
* ✔ Adds a function name (`addConstant`).
* ✔ Removes the `int` type declaration (not valid in JavaScript).
* ✔ Makes it clear that 'a' and 'b' are constant values within the function.

**Option 3: Function that adds a and b to c (Assuming you wanted to add external variables a and b to c. This is
generally bad practice but included for completeness)**

```javascript
let a = 5; // declare a and b in the outer scope
let b = 10;
const addToExternal = (c) => {
return c + a + b;
};
```

💡 Improvements:

* ✔ Uses an arrow function syntax, which is concise.
* ✔ Correctly declares c as a parameter
* ✔ Demonstrates how to utilize variables from the outer scope.
* ✔ Adds a function name (`addToExternal`).
* ✔ Removes the `int` type declaration (not valid in JavaScript).
* 🔴 **Important Note:** While this *works*, it's *highly* discouraged to rely on variables defined outside the
function's scope without explicitly passing them as arguments. It makes the function less predictable and harder to
reason about. The `add` function (Option 1) is almost always the preferred way to write this.

**Final Notes:**

* This review highlights the importance of proper syntax in JavaScript. Even a small error can prevent the code from
running.
* Always declare variables before using them. JavaScript will attempt to automatically declare a variable, leading to
unexpected scoping. In modern Javascript use 'let' or 'const' to declare variables explicitly.
* Understanding scope is crucial for writing maintainable JavaScript code. Pass variables as arguments instead of
relying on global scope whenever possible.
* JavaScript does not require explicit type definitions like `int`. While TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript, *does*
support static typing, standard JavaScript is dynamically typed.
